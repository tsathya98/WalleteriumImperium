Problem Statement:
Receipt Management for Google Wallet
The Challenge: Google Wallet is designed to provide fast, secure access to everyday essentials. However, managing physical receipts remains a cumbersome task for users, leading to lost records, difficulty tracking expenses, and an inability to leverage purchase data for personal benefit. There's a clear need for a seamless way to digitize, organize, and utilize receipt information directly within Google Wallet, enabling users to gain valuable insights into their spending habits and optimize their financial management.

The Objective: Build "Project Raseed," an AI-powered personal assistant that acts as a comprehensive receipt manager and financial advisor for everyday users. This assistant should provide actionable intelligence to users, enabling them to easily track expenses, gain insights into spending, and identify opportunities for savings. The agent should:

Multimodal Receipt Ingestion and Analysis: Receive photos, video, or live stream feeds of receipts in any language. The agent will use Gemini’s multimodal capabilities to instantly analyze the media, determine individual items, extract the value, amount, taxes, and other fees, store this information, and share it as passes that can be added to Google Wallet. The items will be available as text information in the back of the pass (details), and the pass can contain links that will link back to the personal assistant for more information.
Local Language Query and Pass Generation: Allow users to create requests in their local language (e.g., "What can I cook with the food I bought from the last two weeks?", or “What ingredients do I need to buy to be able to cook this dish?”, or “Do I have enough laundry detergent for my weekly laundry?”). If the response is something that can be added to Google Wallet, such as a shopping list, the agent, built with Vertex AI Agent Builder, should create a pass to be added to Google Wallet with the items listed in the pass details.
Spending Analysis and Savings Suggestions: Reply to queries about how much the user is spending on different categories (e.g., "How much did I spend on groceries last month?"). The agent will use a Gemini model to analyze spending trends and suggest ways to save money, such as identifying recurring subscriptions or suggesting cheaper alternatives for frequently purchased items. The assistant should share the most relevant insights about the user's finances in a pass that can be added to Google Wallet (e.g., “Your spending is trending up”, or “There’s an opportunity to save on groceries this week”). This pass should be updated whenever there are changes in the user insights, and generating push notifications with the Google Wallet API is a nice addition to the user experience.
Seamless Google Wallet API Integration: Directly integrate with the Google Wallet API to programmatically create, manage, and push these customized passes to the user's wallet.
Tech Stack: Use of Google AI technologies.
