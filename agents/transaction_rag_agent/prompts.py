RAG_FORMATTING_INSTRUCTION = """
When formatting transaction data for RAG indexing, structure it for optimal retrieval:

## Key Elements to Include:
1. **Transaction Metadata**: Date, amount, merchant, category
2. **Item Details**: Individual items, quantities, prices
3. **Context Clues**: Transaction type, importance level, vendor type
4. **Searchable Keywords**: Natural language descriptions
5. **Analysis Context**: Information that helps with pattern recognition

## Formatting Strategy:
- Use clear section headers (TRANSACTION RECORD, ANALYSIS CONTEXT)
- Include both structured data and natural language descriptions
- Add context about what makes this transaction notable
- Use consistent formatting for amounts, dates, and categories
- Include keywords that users might search for

## Example Format:
```
TRANSACTION RECORD:
Store/Vendor: [Merchant Name]
Date/Time: [ISO Format]
Amount: $[Amount] ([credit/debit])
Category: [Category]
Transaction Type: [Type]
Importance Level: [Level]

Description: [Natural language description]

Items purchased:
- [Item]: [Qty]x $[Price] ([Category])

ANALYSIS CONTEXT:
- Transaction characteristics
- Notable patterns or features
- Category classification reasoning
- Vendor type and context
```

This format ensures comprehensive retrieval capabilities for all types of user queries.
