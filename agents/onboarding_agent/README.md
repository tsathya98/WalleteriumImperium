## üéÆ Demo Conversation Flow

```
User: Hello
Agent: Welcome! I'm excited to help you create your financial profile. 
       Let's start with a fun question - if you unexpectedly received 
       ‚Çπ50,000 today, what would you do with it?

User: I'd probably invest half in stocks and save the rest
Agent: Great! You sound like someone who thinks strategically about money. 
       Have you invested in stocks before? What draws you to them?

User: Yes, I have some Infosys shares and a small mutual fund
Agent: Excellent! Let's catalog those. How many Infosys shares do you own 
       and when did you buy them?

User: 100 shares bought at ‚Çπ1500 each in August 2023
Agent: Perfect! Now, do you own any property, gold, or other investments?

User: I have a 1200 sq ft apartment in Mumbai worth about ‚Çπ50 lakhs
